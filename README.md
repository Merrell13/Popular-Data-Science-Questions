What should data science courses be about?

I am working for a company that creates data science content, be it books, online articles, videos or interactive text-based platforms like Dataquest.

I have been tasked with figuring out what is best content to write about.

I have decided to explore the Data Science Stack Exchange (DSSE). This is a question and answer site where people can ask and answer questions about data science and is part Stack Exchange. By looking through their data I will be able to see which topics get talked about the most and are therefore the most popular.

Stack Exchange provides a public data base for each of its websites. Here's a link to query and explore Data Science Stack Exchange's database: https://data.stackexchange.com/datascience/query/new.

Looking through the database the following columns will be useful for finding the most common posts and topics on the Data Science site.

Id: An identification number for the post.
PostTypeId: An identification number for the type of post.
CreationDate: The date and time of creation of the post.
Score: The post's score.
ViewCount: How many times the post was viewed.
Tags: What tags were used.
AnswerCount: How many answers the question got (only applicable to question posts).
FavoriteCount: How many times the question was favored (only applicable to question posts).
